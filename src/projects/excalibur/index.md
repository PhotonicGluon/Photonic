A trustless, secure file management solution using military-grade encryption.

The spark for making Excalibur came when I needed to archive some security documents and contracts. I wanted to be able to access these documents from anywhere at any time, but because they contained sensitive information, I was not comfortable with storing them on existing cloud storage solutions (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.). I needed a way to store these files online, thus making them accessible, but encrypted.

After a few months of work, I was able to design and implement Excalibur. It is a trustless, secure file management solution using military-grade encryption.

I have also written [a blog post](/blog/2025-10-04/designing-a-zero-trust-secure-file-manager) on the design of Excalibur.
