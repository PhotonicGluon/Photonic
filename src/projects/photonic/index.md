Making cool things.

The spark for creating _Photonic_ was born 2024, when I suddenly had inspiration to update [_Overwrite_](/projects/overwrite) to look cooler and more modern. It was only in December that I decided to embark on the long process of modernising the portfolio site &mdash; to use modern web frameworks like [Astro](https://astro.build/) and CSS frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to design a site that can truly last for years.

_Photonic_ continues to serve as a portfolio site for my projects; a nice display of the things that I have done and are currently doing. I
will continue to update it until I stop making things.
