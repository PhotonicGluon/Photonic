# Writing inline expressions

```md
This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
```

```md
This sentence uses `$$` delimiters to show math inline: $$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$
```

This sentence uses `$$` delimiters to show math inline: $$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

# Writing expressions as blocks

To add a math expression as a block, start a new line, delimit the expression with two dollar symbols `$$`, followed by a new line.

```md
**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$
```

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Alternatively, you can use the ` ```math ` code block syntax to display a math expression as a block. With this syntax, you don't need to use `$$` delimiters. The following will render the same as above:

# Writing dollar signs in line with and within mathematical expressions

To display a dollar sign as a character in the same line as a mathematical expression, you need to escape the non-delimiter `$` to ensure the line renders correctly.

- Outside a math expression, but on the same line, use a backslash to escape the `$`.

    ```
    To split \$100 in half, we calculate $100/2$
- Within a math expression, use double dollar signs and add a `\` symbol before the explicit `$`.

    ```md
    This expression uses `\$` to display a dollar sign: $$\sqrt{\$4}$$
    ```

    This expression uses `\$` to display a dollar sign: $$\sqrt{\$4}$$
