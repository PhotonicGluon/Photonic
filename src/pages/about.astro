        <p>Hello! Welcome to my site! I hope you like it!</p>
        <p>
            I am <b>Kan Onn Kit</b> (Ryan Kan), a Singaporean. I am known as <code>PhotonicGluon</code> online. I am
            a programmer by trade and a hobbyist writer and music composer on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
            I studied at Nanyang Junior College (NYJC). My education there allowed me to foster teamwork and
            collaboration skills, as well as develop a good work ethic. I am often described as a level-headed
            person when making decisions. I consider the facts and evidence of the matter instead of relying
            (solely) on emotion and feeling. I am sociable and love to work in a team. Challenges are appealing to
            me, as they allow me to showcase my problem-solving skillset and come up with a solution.
