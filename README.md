# Photonic

Photonic Website.

## Setup

Development of the website primarily occurs in a devcontainer.

[![Dev Container](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Container&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/Photonic)

If you already have Visual Studio Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/PhotonicGluon/Photonic) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use. Follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) for more details.

> [!IMPORTANT] For Windows
> If you are setting up the devcontainer on a Windows machine, it is recommended to clone this project into WSL. Otherwise, file watching would not work as intended.
